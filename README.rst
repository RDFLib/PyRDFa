PyRDFa
======

**THIS IS AN OUTDATED VERSION OF AN RDFa PARSER, KEPT ONLY FOR HISTORICAL REASONS**

This software is replaced by `pyrdfa3 <https://github.com/RDFLib/pyrdfa3>`_ which has been updated to RDFa 1.1 and has also been used to incorporate native RDFa processing into RDFLib. Keep away from this version :-)

(I do not know whether there users directly referring to this URI and repo, that is the only reason I do not remove the repo altogether.)

=============

An RDFa parser for Python, also referred to as a “RDFa Distiller”. 

It is deployed, via a CGI front-end, on the W3C `RDFa Distiller page <http://www.w3.org/2007/08/pyRdfa/>`.
